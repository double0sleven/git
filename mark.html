    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2> 

    <p>
      The credible hulk is every bit as awesome as his more famous cousin. Where Bruce Banner focuses primarily on delivering death and destruction to fictional enemies and other preposterous threats, the credible Hulk focuses primarily on the destruction of willful ignorance through the devastation of poorly conceived arguments.

    <h2>Famous Friends: The Avengers</h2> 
    
    <p>
        The Avengers are a fictional team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team made its debut in The Avengers #1 (cover-dated Sept. 1963), created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby. The Avengers is Lee and Kirby's renovation of a previous superhero team, All-Winners Squad, that appeared in comic books series published Marvel Comics' predecessor Timely Comics.
